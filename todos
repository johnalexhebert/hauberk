1. issue - player does not have the choice to forfeit a level.
2. feature - a well-protected room contains an immovable orb that shows the current location of all monsters with teleportation abilities. The player must stand on the same tile as the orb.
3. recipe: Cloak of Cold Resistance - fur-cloak + (salve of cold resistance * 4)
4. item/recipe: Open Portal - temporarily opens a teleporation doorway between home and the tile in the dungeon where the scroll was used.
5. monsters are too easy to kill in the later dungeons as player progresses. More powerful monsters should spawn in harder dungeons. Larger groups should spawn in hard dungeons. Monsters should be able to hear player activity better.
6. poisons don't do enough damage at harder levels. Large spiders and mages should have dangerous poisons requiring the use of antidote.
7. It is too easy for the player to hide in a room and heal from eating food.
8. Food is handed out too easily. (?) Use this to tweak game balance.
9. Achieving the quest requirement should display an indicator on the side. The player should be encouraged to continue playing to progress, though the dungeon will get harder.
10. Doors that break open and disappear by powerful monsters if they know player is on the other side.
11. Short bows are useless without arrors.
12. recipe - stick + black feather = arrow
13. whips are useless. why are there? should be sticks
